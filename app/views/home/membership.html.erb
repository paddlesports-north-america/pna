      <h3>Reinstatement</h3>
      <p>Where individual membership has lapsed, BCU/SCA/WCA/CANI Coaching Service qualifications can be restored on the following basis:</p>
      <p>If the membership is allowed to lapse for a period of less than 3 years the coach can reactivate qualifications by paying the current yearâ€™s membership plus an administration fee and completing the coach update requirements pertaining at the time.</p>
      <p>If the lapsed period exceeds 3 years, the coach must pay the current years membership fee, reinstatement administration fee, plus a $50.00 fee to cover revalidation.  This will be in the form of an action plan plus a workshop or working alongside a course provider. (As deemed by their National Coaching Officer)*. Costs for workshops will be extra.</p>
      <p>If the member is a coach and holds assessor status, re-instatement of the Assessor status held would not be automatic. Re-instatement of assessor status as appropriate (possibly at a lower level) would be re-activated on application via an agreed action plan and possible charge.</p>
      <p>A decision on an application for assessor re-instatement and any associated action plan would depend on the number of years of lapsed membership.</p>
      <p>*(In order to complete this process the party concerned is advised to contact their Coaching Office to initiate the process).</p>
      <p>Coaching qualifications are only valid whilst the member holds a current first aid award.  For levels 1 and 2 coaches, this needs to be four hours training including CPR. For level 3 coaches and above eight hours including CPR/EAV.  This information is held on the database.  Please forward a copy of your first aid certificate with your re-instatement application.</p>
